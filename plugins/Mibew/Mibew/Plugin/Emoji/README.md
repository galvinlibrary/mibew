# Mibew Emoji plugin

It replaces emojis codes with images in chat messages. The full list of supported emojis can be found at http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/

Emoticons like :-) and ;D are also supported.


## Installation

1. Get the archive with the plugin sources. At the moment the only option is to build the plugin from sources.

2. Untar/unzip the plugin's archive.

3. Put files of the plugins to the `<Mibew root>/plugins`  folder.

4. (optional) Add plugins configs to "plugins" structure in "`<Mibew root>`/configs/config.yml". If the "plugins" stucture looks like `plugins: []` it will become:
    ```yaml
    plugins:
        "Mibew:Emoji": # Plugin's configurations are described below
            ignore_emoticons: false
    ```

5. Navigate to "`<Mibew Base URL>`/operator/plugin" page and enable the plugin.


## Plugin's configurations

The plugin can be configured with values in "`<Mibew root>`/configs/config.yml" file.

### config.ignore_emoticons

Type: `Boolean`

Default: `false`

If set to true, the plugin only converts :emoji: and ignore emoticons like :-) and ;D. This value is optional and can be skipped.


## Build from sources

There are several actions one should do before use the latest version of the plugin from the repository:

1. Obtain a copy of the repository using `git clone`, download button, or another way.
2. Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/).
3. Install [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).
4. Install npm dependencies using `npm install`.
5. Run Gulp to build the sources using `gulp default`.

Finally `.tar.gz` and `.zip` archives of the ready-to-use Plugin will be available in `release` directory.
